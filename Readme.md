## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing delivery operations, including tracking cards, handling delivery exceptions, managing pickups, and tracking returns. The system offers functionalities to import data from CSV files, update card statuses, and perform CRUD operations on various entities involved in the delivery process.



## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend server is built using Node.js, providing an efficient and scalable runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Express.js is used as the web application framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB serves as the database management system, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing data.
- **Mongoose:** MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, used for database operations and schema definition.
- **dotenv:** Module for loading environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
- **cors:** Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express.js.
- **JavaScript**: The project is primarily implemented using JavaScript for  backend development.



## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization to maintain clarity and modularity. Here's a brief overview:

- **controllers**: Contains controller functions that handle incoming requests and send responses.
- **models**: Contains MongoDB schema definitions and models.
- **routes**: Contains route definitions that map HTTP requests to controller functions.
- **utils**: Contains utility functions used across the application.
- **db**: Contains files related to database connection and configuration.
- **data**: Stores CSV data files for importing into the database.



## Setup and Installation
The project's entry point is the `index.js` file, which imports the Express application (`app`) from `app.js` and connects to the MongoDB database using `connectDB` function from the `db/index.js` file. Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file using `dotenv.config()`.

The `app.js` file initializes the Express application, sets up middleware for handling CORS, JSON parsing, and URL-encoded data, and defines routes for different API endpoints.

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd <project_directory>
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a .env file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Full CRUD functionality for managing cards, deliveries, pickups, and returns.
- **CSV Import:** Import data from CSV files for bulk processing of deliveries, exceptions, and pickups.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling with custom error class.
- **Database Integration:** Seamless integration with MongoDB for storing application data.
- **RESTful API:** Well-structured RESTful API endpoints for easy integration with frontend applications.
- **AsyncHandler Middleware:** Provides error handling for asynchronous request handlers, ensuring that any uncaught errors are passed to the Express error handler middleware. This helps streamline error handling and improves code readability.
- **ApiResponse Class:** Custom class for constructing API responses with standardized formats. The class allows for easy creation of responses with status codes, data payloads, and messages, simplifying the process of sending consistent responses across different endpoints.


## Implementation Details

### Models

The project includes several Mongoose models:

- **Card Model:** Defines the schema for cards data.
- **Returned Model:** Defines the schema for returned items data.
- **Delivered Model:** Defines the schema for delivered items data.
- **Delivery Exception Model:** Defines the schema for delivery exceptions data.
- **Pickup Model:** Defines the schema for pickup items data.

### API Endpoints

The project provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the following entities:

- Cards
- Returned Items
- Delivered Items
- Delivery Exceptions
- Pickup Items

Each entity has corresponding routes and controllers for handling HTTP requests.

For detailed information on API endpoints and their usage, refer to the API documentation or explore the project's codebase.

## Testing

Testing the API endpoints can be done using tools like Postman or curl. Below are the steps to test the endpoints using Postman:

1. **Install Postman:** If you haven't already, download and install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) on your machine.

2. **Import Environment:** If your API requires environment variables, import the provided environment file into Postman. This file usually contains base URLs, tokens, or other necessary variables.

3. **Send Requests:** Open Postman and start sending requests to the API endpoints. Make sure to choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each request.

4. **Set Headers and Body:** Set any required headers (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization) and include request body parameters if necessary.

5. **Test Endpoint Responses:** Send requests to each endpoint and verify the responses. Check for status codes, response body content, and headers to ensure the API is functioning as expected.

6. **Test Error Handling:** Also, test error handling by sending requests with invalid parameters or unauthorized requests. Verify that the API responds with appropriate error messages and status codes.

7. **Monitor Performance:** Monitor the performance of API requests, including response times and any potential bottlenecks.


## Possible Improvements

- **Machine Learning or AI Features:** Explore opportunities to leverage machine learning or artificial intelligence algorithms for tasks such as recommendation engines, predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, or personalized content delivery, adding intelligence and automation to the application.
- **User Management System:** Introduce a user management system with features such as user registration, login, profile management, and role-based access control (RBAC), allowing users to securely access and manage their accounts within the application.
- **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to keep users informed about important events, updates, or reminders related to their interactions with the platform, enhancing user engagement and communication.
- **File Uploads and Management:** Integrate functionality for uploading, storing, and managing files or documents associated with specific entities within the application, such as user profiles, product images, or document attachments.
